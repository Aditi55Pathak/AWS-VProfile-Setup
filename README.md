## Project 1: Lift and Shift Application Workload

### Overview
The aim of this project is to lift and shift a multi-tier web application stack (VPROFILE) from on-premises infrastructure to the AWS Cloud. This strategy involves moving application services running on physical or virtual machines in a data center to the cloud without making significant changes to the application architecture.

### Goals
- Move the VPROFILE application stack to AWS Cloud.
- Ensure the application runs smoothly in a production environment on AWS.
- Leverage AWS services for better scalability, reliability, and cost-efficiency.

### Architecture
- **Frontend**: Hosted on EC2 instances behind an Elastic Load Balancer.
- **Application Layer**: Deployed on EC2 instances with Auto Scaling.
- **Database Layer**: Managed by Amazon RDS.
- **Storage**: Amazon S3 for static content.
- **Networking**: VPC, Subnets, Security Groups, and Route Tables.

### Steps
1. **Setup AWS Environment**:
   - Create a new VPC with public and private subnets.
   - Configure security groups and network ACLs.
2. **Migrate Frontend**:
   - Launch EC2 instances for the frontend.
   - Configure Elastic Load Balancer and Auto Scaling groups.
3. **Migrate Application Layer**:
   - Launch EC2 instances for the application layer.
   - Set up Auto Scaling and configure load balancing.
4. **Migrate Database**:
   - Set up Amazon RDS for the database.
   - Migrate data from on-premises to Amazon RDS.
5. **Storage Migration**:
   - Move static content to Amazon S3.
   - Update application configuration to use S3.
6. **Testing and Validation**:
   - Perform comprehensive testing to ensure the application works as expected in the AWS environment.
   - Validate performance, security, and compliance.

## Project 2: Re-Architecting Web App on AWS Cloud

### Overview
The project focuses on re-architecting a web application on the AWS cloud to enhance agility and improve business continuity. This involves migrating services running on physical, virtual, and cloud machines to AWS services to increase operational efficiency and scalability.

### Goals
- Re-architect the web application for cloud-native architecture.
- Improve scalability, reliability, and operational efficiency.
- Enhance business continuity and disaster recovery capabilities.

### Architecture
- **Frontend**: Deployed on AWS Amplify or S3 with CloudFront.
- **Backend**: Using AWS Lambda functions and API Gateway.
- **Database**: Amazon Aurora or DynamoDB for high availability and performance.
- **Storage**: Amazon S3 for static assets.
- **CI/CD**: Implemented using AWS CodePipeline, CodeBuild, and CodeDeploy.
- **Monitoring and Logging**: Amazon CloudWatch and AWS X-Ray.

### Steps
1. **Assessment and Planning**:
   - Analyze the current application architecture.
   - Plan the re-architecture strategy.
2. **Setup AWS Environment**:
   - Create necessary AWS resources (VPC, Subnets, Security Groups).
3. **Re-Architect Frontend**:
   - Migrate frontend to AWS Amplify or S3 with CloudFront.
4. **Re-Architect Backend**:
   - Develop backend services using AWS Lambda and API Gateway.
   - Implement microservices architecture if applicable.
5. **Database Migration**:
   - Choose appropriate database service (Aurora or DynamoDB).
   - Migrate data and ensure high availability.
6. **CI/CD Pipeline**:
   - Set up a CI/CD pipeline using AWS CodePipeline, CodeBuild, and CodeDeploy.
7. **Monitoring and Logging**:
   - Configure Amazon CloudWatch for monitoring.
   - Set up AWS X-Ray for debugging and tracing.
8. **Testing and Validation**:
   - Perform thorough testing to ensure the application functions correctly.
   - Validate performance, security, and compliance.
